/**
 * Mode Select
 *
 * This cluster provides an interface for controlling a characteristic of a device that can be set to one of several
 * predefined values. For example, the light pattern of a disco ball, the mode of a massage chair, or the wash cycle of
 * a laundry machine.
 *
 * The server allows the client to set a mode on the server. A mode is one of a list of options that may be presented
 * by a client for a user choice, or understood by the client, via the semantic tags on the mode.
 *
 * A semantic tag is either a standard tag within a standard category namespace, or a manufacturer specific tag, within
 * the namespace of the vendor ID of the manufacturer. If there is no semantic tag, the mode is anonymous, and the
 * selection is made by the user solely based on the Label string.
 *
 * Each cluster ID that indicates this specification shall define a distinct purpose for the cluster instance. For
 * example: A LightBlinking cluster ID supports blinking modes for a light (and is described that way).
 *
 * An anonymous mode shall support the derived cluster purpose. A manufacturer specific semantic tag shall support the
 * derived cluster purpose. An anonymous mode shall NOT replace the meaning of a standard semantic tag, when one
 * exists, for the cluster purpose.
 *
 * @see {@link MatterApplicationClusterSpecificationV1_1} ยง 1.8
