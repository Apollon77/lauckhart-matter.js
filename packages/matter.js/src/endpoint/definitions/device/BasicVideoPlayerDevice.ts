/**
 * This defines conformance to the Basic Video Player device type.
 *
 * A Video Player (either Basic or Casting) represents a device that is able to play media to a physical output or to a
 * display screen which is part of the device.
 *
 * A Basic Video Player has playback controls (play, pause, etc.) and keypad remote controls (up, down, number input),
 * but is not able to launch content and is not a content app platform (the Casting Video Player device type is used
 * for these functions).
 *
 * For example, a Basic Video Player can be a traditional TV device a physical media playback device such as a DVD
 * Player, or a device that provides input to another device like a TV or computer monitor.
 *
 * Please see Video Player Architecture for additional Basic Video Player requirements relating to Video Player device
 * endpoint composition, commissioning, feature representation in clusters, and UI context.
 *
 * @see {@link MatterDeviceLibrarySpecificationV1_1} ยง 10.2
